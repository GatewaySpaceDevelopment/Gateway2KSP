# Gateway2KSP
The official mod pack for Gateway's Kerbal Space Program multiplayer server!

Recommended KSP version: **1.12.5**
Current pack version: **v1.0**
Release date: **August 6th, 2024**
~~~
Our mod pack is in constant evolution in order to fit the needs of our players and fix bugs. Please make sure this is the most up to date version before installing!
~~~

**HOW TO INSTALL THE MOD PACK**

It’s very simple! Just copy all the contents of Gateway2KSP/GameData into KSP’s GameData folder and you should be all set!
~~~
In order to avoid any conflicts, we suggest temporarily removing all other mods you may have previously installed (don’t make the fatal mistake of removing the “Squad” folder, though!). Also make sure that you’re running the latest version of KSP (1.12.5).
